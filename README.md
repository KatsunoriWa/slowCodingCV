# slowCodingCV
Slow code sample using OpenCV

## Aim
 This sample codes show how to use OpenCV slow.
 I recommend you to use OpenCV function instead of writing for loop using pixel access. 
 This is a tutorial to show that you should use OpenCV builtin functions instead of writing code with for loops by yourself.
 This does not provide any useful library to use.
 
## How to build

```
